Plots and figures:

Figures
Project flowsheet 
Database creation (including window cutting)
CNN - final model or show as variable model. Including input
Marker gene database creation - clustering visualisation
Transformer - Including input, ie. translation and annotation 
Inference - Different types, sliding algorithm, coordinate prediction.

Plots
-Input data
Summary statistics on input databases
	Genome size and gene counts
	Class label imbalance
	Species distribution
		optional species distribution by class
Nucleotide identity
	Heat map
		Between sequence types
		Between satellite class labels
			(super optional tree: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9380445/)

-Modelling
	CNN:
		Architecture search (wandb in appendix)
	Transformer:
		Architecture search (wandb in appendix)
	The four model comparisons
		Baseline - CNN - Transformer - CNN+Transformer
		AUC on the different datasets
		Confusion matrix on final dataset
		Probability score distribution for each class label!
	
	Final model
		5-fold cross validation AUC with shade.
		Score distribution - correct and wrong label calls
		Score distribution pr. label

-Inference only with best model
