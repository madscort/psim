Preface
Abstract

-Introduction
Phage satellites.
Why they are important
Where we stand now
The data behind this project

>Project scope
1. Merge the data
2. Build a training dataset
3. Create models
4. Test it on real data
5. Enterpret the results

-Theoretical background / Introduction

>Phage satellites
	Type of MGE
	Lifestyle
	Genetic building blocks
	Types of phage satellites in dataset
		Can you define a phage satellite

>Deep learning
Why is this even meaningful for this project.

Two different model types:
CNN - deeper unknown structures

Transformer - sequence of features

(Super optional: Pre-trained DNA-sequence model)

-Materials and methods

>Pre processing dataset
	
	The databases
		How they were created

	* PLOT pre processing overview

	Dataset creation
		Phage satellite database merge
			Overlap
			Homology reduction
		Prophage sequences
		Host sequences
		Random metagenomic data

>Modelling on dataset

	Baseline model

	Neural networks
		General modelling setup

		CNN model
			Hyperparameter and architecture tuning
		
		Transformer model
			Creation of marker gene database
				pfam only full
				de-novo hmms for satellites
				hhblits for enrichment for satellites
				satellites only

>Inference on real data
	How inference is done:
		Sliding window
	Data from different projects
		Difference between:
			body location
			environment sludge, water, etc.
			time period

-Results

>Input database
	*Plot Homology reduction
	*Plot Host diversity
	*Sequence lengths, gene counts
	*Show somehow the homology within groups and opposite between groups

>Modelling
	Tuning and design
		Model comparison on different versions of the dataset
			Primary - only random metagenomics and random viral genes
				How to tell this story? Baseline too good. Increase homology reduction, increase viral samples
			First improvement - random metagenomics and prohages from same host
			Second improvement - random metagenomics, host sequences and prophages same host
	
	Validation: Kfold cross-validation
		Only final models


	Interpretation: Feature contributions to predictions
		CNN: absolute values of gradients. 



>Inference
	Diversity - how many different host species. (can you use alpha/beta diversity?)
	(Super optional: Abundance - dont think this is possible. would need to map back etc.)

-Discussion

>Preprocessing
Database creation
	Was the data actually usable? Gigantic overlap.
	When using results of algorithmic search - will we just learn the algorithms?
	What are the limitations of creating your own dataset?

>Modelling

Choice of model types:
	
	Couldnt we just have taken a conventional approach? not scope of project

	Investigation into the use of structural information
		-> alphafold, colabfold, using pre-trained ESM model for embeddings on proteins (contains structural information).

	CNN should be able to tak input learn something from a wide area and reduce the information step by step. Ie. kmers etc etc.

Does the models actually learn anything?
	Machine learning models cannot learn something that it hasnt been shown.

>Inference
Is the output from the real-data experiments meaningful?


-Conclusion
